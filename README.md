Data Cleaning Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning a dataset of data science job postings sourced from Indeed. The primary goal is to prepare the data for analysis by handling issues such as missing values, incorrect data types, and any other anomalies found in the dataset.

Files:
  - DataCleaning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all the data cleaning steps.
  - Indeeded-Data Science Jobs List 3.csv: Original dataset used for cleaning.
Requirements:
  To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy

You can install these libraries using pip:

    pip install pandas numpy

Data Cleaning Steps
The data cleaning process includes:

1. Initial Data Exploration: Assessing the basic properties of the dataset.
2. Handling Missing Values: Imputing missing values with appropriate statistical    measures (mean, median, or mode).
3. Correcting Data Types: Converting columns to their correct data types.
4. Removing Duplicates: Identifying and removing any duplicate entries.
   
Usage
To use this project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open the DataCleaning.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells in sequence to perform data cleaning.
